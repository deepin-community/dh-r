dh-update-R:
  * Injects versioned Build-Depends even if all released
    of Debian have this version (will be removed by
       cme fix dpkg-control afterwards
  * Should keep comments


Versioned dependencies:
  As explained in a bug against r-cran-adegraphics
     https://bugs.debian.org/908065#25
  -->
  adding a -~~ (or something along those lines) to any upstream version in
  such relations will prevent an upstream hyphen from being treated as the
  separator between the upstream version and the Debian revision number.

manpages:
 * man scripts still miss them, maybe something autogenerated with help2man would be nice


install suggests for autopkgtest:

  For autopkgtest-pkg-r its needed to install more packages than Depends.  An
  attempt was made in autopkgtest-pkg-r but this is not run as root and thus
  does not work (see bug #961138).  Here is the code snippet that was tried -
  but it needs to be found out where to sneak this in properly

  # install Suggests since these are usually needed for testing
  suggests=$(apt-cache depends ${pkgname} | grep Suggests | sed 's/Suggests: //')
  if [ "$suggests" != "" ] ; then
    apt-get install -y ${suggeste}
  fi
  
  # install additional Test-Depends that can be specifed in debian/tests/control
  if [ -d debian/tests ] ; then
    if [ -e debian/tests/control ] ; then
      apt-get install -y `grep Depends debian/tests/control | sed -e 's/^Depends://' -e 's/@builddeps@//' -e 's/@//g' -e 's/,//g'`
    fi
  fi
